<h3>About the Experiment</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of this experiment is to study the working principle of a centrifugal pump and to determine its efficiency experimentally. A centrifugal pump is a mechanical device that moves fluid by converting rotational kinetic energy to hydrodynamic energy of the fluid flow. The rotational energy typically comes from an engine or electric motor.
</p>
<p>
  In this setup, students will operate a centrifugal pump and take measurements of various parameters such as suction head, delivery head, discharge rate, and input power. By calculating the output power using the measured values and comparing it to the input power, the efficiency of the pump can be determined.
</p>
<p>
  This experiment helps students understand the key performance characteristics of centrifugal pumps, including the effects of flow rate and head on efficiency. It also provides hands-on experience in using measuring instruments and interpreting experimental results, which are essential skills in fluid mechanics and pump engineering applications.
