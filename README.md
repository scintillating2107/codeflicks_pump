<b> Experiment|     <b> To Study the working principle of a centrifugal pump and determine its efficiency experimentally

### About the Experiment 

A centrifugal pump works on the principle of centrifugal force. When a liquid enters the rotating impeller at the center (eye), it is thrown outward by the spinning impeller blades. This action:

1. Increases the liquidâ€™s velocity (kinetic energy).

2. The casing (usually volute-shaped) then converts this kinetic energy into pressure energy.

3. This pressurized fluid is then delivered through the discharge pipe.
