    <h2>Experiment</h2>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> To study the working principle of a centrifugal pump and determine its efficiency experimentally.</p>

    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
      The aim of this experiment is to investigate the working principle of a centrifugal pump and to experimentally determine its efficiency under various operating conditions. This includes measuring the suction head, delivery head, discharge, and input power to the pump, and using these measurements to calculate the output power and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this experiment, students will gain practical understanding of how a centrifugal pump functions, the energy conversion process involved, and the relationship between head, discharge, and power. The objective is also to analyze how changes in flow rate and head affect the pump's performance and efficiency.
    </p>

    <h3>About the Experiment</h3>
    <p>
      This experiment is designed to help students understand the working principle of a centrifugal pump, which is commonly used in various industries for fluid transport. The centrifugal pump operates by converting mechanical energy into hydraulic energy through the centrifugal force generated by the rotating impeller.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this setup, students will operate a centrifugal pump and take measurements of various parameters such as suction head, delivery head, discharge rate, and input power. By calculating the output power using the measured values and comparing it to the input power, the efficiency of the pump can be determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experiment helps students understand the key performance characteristics of centrifugal pumps, including the effects of flow rate and head on efficiency. It also provides hands-on experience in using measuring instruments and interpreting experimental results, which are essential skills in fluid mechanics and pump engineering applications.
