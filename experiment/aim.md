### Aim of the experiment

To thoroughly study the working principle of a centrifugal pump by understanding how it converts mechanical energy into hydraulic energy using centrifugal action, and to experimentally determine its efficiency by measuring the input power supplied to the pump and the hydraulic output power developed during operation.

  This includes:

  ~~Examining the key components of the centrifugal pump such as the impeller, casing, suction and delivery pipes, and motor.

  ~~Observing the fluid dynamics inside the pump as it transitions from low pressure at the impeller center to high pressure at the 
  periphery.

  ~~Measuring important parameters such as discharge, pressure head, and input power to calculate the actual efficiency of the pump under 
  various operating conditions.
