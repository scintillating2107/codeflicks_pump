    <h1>Experiment</h1>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> To study the working principle of a centrifugal pump and determine its efficiency experimentally.</p>

    <h2>Aim</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of this experiment is to study the working principle of a centrifugal pump and determine its efficiency under various conditions.
      The experiment involves measuring parameters such as suction head, delivery head, discharge rate, and input power. Using these measurements,
      the output power and overall efficiency of the pump can be calculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experiment helps students understand how energy is transferred from the rotating impeller to the fluid, and how changes in flow conditions affect pump performance.
      It also enhances practical knowledge in fluid mechanics and energy conversion processes used in industrial pumping systems.
    </p>

    <h2>About the Experiment</h2>
    <p>
      A centrifugal pump is a mechanical device that moves fluids by converting rotational energy, typically from a motor, into hydrodynamic energy. The pump consists of an impeller that rotates inside a casing. As the impeller spins, it imparts kinetic energy to the fluid. This kinetic energy is then converted into pressure energy as the fluid exits the impeller and flows through the pump casing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this experiment, students will operate a centrifugal pump setup and take real-time measurements to analyze performance. The main objective is to measure the input and output parameters and calculate the efficiency, which is the ratio of output power to input power.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hands-on activity helps students understand key performance characteristics like head, flow rate, and power consumption. It also provides a foundation for understanding pump selection and application in real-world engineering systems.
