### The aim of this experiment is to study and understand the working principle of a centrifugal pump, which is widely used in industries to transport fluids by converting mechanical energy into hydraulic energy. The experiment involves operating the centrifugal pump under different conditions, measuring important parameters such as suction head, delivery head, discharge rate, and input power. Using these measurements, the output power delivered by the pump can be calculated, and the efficiency of the pump can be determined by comparing the output power with the input power.
