  <h2>Aim</h2>
  <p>
    The aim of this experiment is to study and understand the working principle of a centrifugal pump, 
    which is widely used in industries to transport fluids by converting mechanical energy into hydraulic energy. 
    The experiment involves operating the centrifugal pump under different conditions, 
    measuring important parameters such as suction head, delivery head, discharge rate, and input power. 
    Using these measurements, the output power delivered by the pump can be calculated, 
    and the efficiency of the pump can be determined by comparing the output power with the input power.
  </p>
  <p>
    This experiment helps in analyzing the performance characteristics of centrifugal pumps, 
    understanding the relationship between flow rate and pump head, 
    and evaluating how efficiently the pump converts input energy into useful hydraulic energy. 
    The results of the experiment are useful for practical applications and design considerations in fluid mechanics and pump engineering.
