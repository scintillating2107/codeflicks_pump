  <h1>Procedure: Study of Working Principle of Centrifugal Pump and Determination of Its Efficiency</h1>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Procedure</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Setup:</strong> Connect the centrifugal pump to the power source and ensure all piping (suction and delivery) is properly connected with valves and pressure gauges installed at correct points.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Priming the Pump:</strong> Before starting the pump, fill the pump casing and suction pipe with water to remove air and prevent air binding.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Switch On the Pump:</strong> Turn on the motor to start the centrifugal pump. Initially, keep the delivery valve closed or slightly open.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Adjust Discharge:</strong> Gradually open the delivery valve to allow flow through the pump outlet. Set the valve to a desired opening for the first test run.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Record Readings:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Measure the flow rate (Q) using a flow meter or volumetric tank and stopwatch.</li>
        <li>Note the suction pressure (P<sub>s</sub>) and delivery pressure (P<sub>d</sub>) using pressure gauges or manometers.</li>
        <li>Measure the electrical power input (P<sub>in</sub>) to the motor with a wattmeter.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Calculate Manometric Head (H<sub>m</sub>):</strong> Use the pressure readings to calculate the manometric head developed by the pump.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Repeat for Different Loads:</strong> Adjust the delivery valve to obtain different discharge values. For each setting, record flow rate, pressures, and power input.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Calculate Efficiency:</strong> For each load, compute the hydraulic output power using the formula:
      <br />
      <em>Output Power = ρ × g × Q × H<sub>m</sub></em>
      <br />
      Then, calculate the efficiency:
      <br />
      <em>Efficiency (η) = (Output Power / Input Power) × 100%</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Analyze Results:</strong> Plot graphs such as Head vs. Discharge, Efficiency vs. Discharge to analyze pump performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shutdown:</strong> Close the delivery valve and switch off the pump. Drain the pump and pipes if necessary.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Always prime the pump before starting to avoid damage.</li>
    <li>Do not run the pump dry to prevent impeller damage.</li>
    <li>Ensure all connections are tight and leak-proof.</li>
    <li>Wear personal protective equipment such as safety goggles and gloves.</li>
    <li>Keep hands and loose clothing away from moving parts.</li>
  </ul>
