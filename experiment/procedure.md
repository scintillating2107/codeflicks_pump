### Procedure

🔧1.. Pre-Operation Checks:

     Ensure Proper Priming:

     Fill the pump casing and suction pipe completely with water to remove air.

     Make sure no air bubbles remain in the suction line (centrifugal pumps cannot pump air).

   B. Inspect Equipment:

     Ensure that the power supply to the pump is OFF before starting.

     Check that all valves, pressure gauges, and flow measuring devices are in good working condition.

     Confirm the suction and delivery pipes are properly connected and leak-free.

   C. Open Valves:

     Open the suction valve completely.

     Keep the delivery valve slightly open to avoid damage due to sudden pressure surge.

⚙️2.. Operation of the Pump:

   A. Start the Motor:

      Switch ON the pump motor and allow the impeller to reach full speed.

      Gradually Adjust Flow:

      Slowly open the delivery valve to allow water to flow through the delivery pipe.

  C. Stabilize the System:

      Let the pump run for a few minutes until the flow and pressures become steady.

      Observe and wait until no significant fluctuations are seen in gauges or measuring devices.

📊3.. Data Collection:

 
    A. Record Input Power:

      Measure the input power using a wattmeter or energy meter connected to the motor.

      Note the voltage, current, and power factor if applicable.
 
      Repeat for Different Valve Openings:

      Change the delivery valve position to vary the discharge.

      Repeat Steps 7–9 for each setting to get multiple data points.

  🚫3.. Post-Operation:

      Turn Off the Motor:

       Gradually close the delivery valve before turning off the pump.

      Drain the System:

        If required, drain the water from the pump and tank after the experiment.

      Record Observations Neatly:

        Enter all measurements into a tabulated format for calculations and plotting.
