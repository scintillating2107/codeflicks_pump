  <h1>Procedure: To Study the Working Principle of a Centrifugal Pump and Determine Its Efficiency Experimentally</h1>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Procedure</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Ensure the pump and all connections (suction pipe, delivery pipe, and valves) are properly installed and tightened.</li>

    <li><strong>Priming the Pump:</strong> Fill the pump casing completely with water to remove air pockets. This is essential to avoid air binding and ensure smooth operation.</li>

    <li><strong>Initial Setup:</strong> Close the delivery valve to prevent flow initially. Switch on the motor driving the centrifugal pump.</li>

    <li><strong>Starting the Pump:</strong> Start the pump and gradually open the delivery valve to allow fluid flow through the outlet pipe.</li>

    <li><strong>Measurement Setup:</strong> Record the readings of the flow rate (Q) using a flow meter or volumetric measuring device.</li>

    <li><strong>Measure Head:</strong> Measure the pressure heads on the suction and delivery sides using pressure gauges or manometers to calculate the manometric head (H<sub>m</sub>).</li>

    <li><strong>Input Power Measurement:</strong> Note the electrical input power supplied to the pump motor using a wattmeter.</li>

    <li><strong>Vary the Load:</strong> Change the discharge by adjusting the delivery valve. For each discharge value, repeat the readings of flow rate, pressure heads, and input power.</li>

    <li><strong>Calculate Efficiency:</strong> Using the recorded values, calculate the output hydraulic power and efficiency for each load condition with the formula:
      <br />
      <em>Efficiency (η) = (Output Power / Input Power) × 100%</em>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Shutdown:</strong> After all readings are taken, close the delivery valve, switch off the motor, and drain the pump if necessary.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the pump is properly primed before starting to avoid damage.</li>
    <li>Do not operate the pump dry as it can damage the impeller.</li>
    <li>Check all connections for leaks before starting.</li>
    <li>Wear safety goggles and gloves during the experiment.</li>
    <li>Keep clear of moving parts during pump operation.</li>
  </ul>
