      "question": "What happens to the manometric head when the discharge of a centrifugal pump increases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases",
        "b": "It decreases",
        "c": "It remains constant",
        "d": "It becomes zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Generally, head decreases as discharge increases due to pump characteristics.",
        "b": "Correct! Usually, manometric head decreases with increase in discharge.",
        "c": "Head varies with discharge, so it doesn't remain constant.",
        "d": "Head does not become zero unless pump stops."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",

    {
      "question": "Which factor primarily affects the efficiency of a centrifugal pump?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Suction pressure only",
        "b": "Discharge and head developed",
        "c": "Material of the impeller",
        "d": "Color of the pump casing"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Suction pressure alone does not determine efficiency.",
        "b": "Correct! Efficiency depends on discharge, head, and input power.",
        "c": "Material affects durability but not efficiency directly.",
        "d": "Color has no effect on efficiency."

      "question": "If the input power to the pump is 2 kW and the output power is 1.5 kW, what is the efficiency?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "75%",
        "b": "133%",
        "c": "3.5%",
        "d": "0.75%"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Efficiency = (1.5 / 2) Ã— 100 = 75%",
        "b": "Efficiency cannot be more than 100%.",
        "c": "Incorrect calculation.",
        "d": "Incorrect calculation."

      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a part of the centrifugal pump?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Impeller",
        "b": "Volute casing",
        "c": "Piston",
        "d": "Shaft"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Impeller is a key part of the pump.",
        "b": "Volute casing directs fluid flow.",
        "c": "Correct! Piston is part of reciprocating pumps, not centrifugal pumps.",
        "d": "Shaft connects motor to impeller."

    {
      "question": "What is the main reason for efficiency loss in a centrifugal pump?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Friction and hydraulic losses",
        "b": "Motor color",
        "c": "Shape of the delivery pipe",
        "d": "Type of valve used"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Friction, turbulence, and hydraulic losses reduce efficiency.",
        "b": "Motor color is irrelevant.",
        "c": "Pipe shape has minor effect compared to losses inside pump.",
        "d": "Valve type affects flow but is not main cause of efficiency loss."
