      "question": "What is the main function of a centrifugal pump?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To compress gases",
        "b": "To convert pressure energy into kinetic energy",
        "c": "To convert mechanical energy into hydraulic energy",
        "d": "To measure the flow of fluid"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Centrifugal pumps do not compress gases, they pump liquids.",
        "b": "The pump actually converts mechanical energy to pressure energy, not pressure to kinetic.",
        "c": "Correct! The pump converts mechanical energy into hydraulic (pressure) energy.",
        "d": "Measuring flow is done by flow meters, not pumps."

    {
      "question": "Which part of the centrifugal pump imparts energy to the fluid?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Casing",
        "b": "Impeller",
        "c": "Delivery pipe",
        "d": "Suction pipe"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The casing directs flow but does not impart energy.",
        "b": "Correct! The impeller imparts kinetic energy to the fluid.",
        "c": "Delivery pipe carries fluid away, no energy addition.",
        "d": "Suction pipe allows fluid entry but doesn’t add energy."
      },

    {
      "question": "Why is priming necessary before starting a centrifugal pump?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To start the motor",
        "b": "To clean the impeller",
        "c": "To fill the pump with water and remove air",
        "d": "To increase the pressure in the suction pipe"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Priming is not related to motor operation.",
        "b": "Priming does not clean the impeller.",
        "c": "Correct! Priming ensures the pump casing is filled with fluid and air is removed.",
        "d": "Pressure increases due to pump operation, not priming."

    {
      "question": "The efficiency of a centrifugal pump is calculated as:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Output power divided by input power",
        "b": "Head divided by discharge",
        "c": "Discharge divided by head",
        "d": "Input power divided by output power"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Efficiency is the ratio of useful output power to input power.",
        "b": "This is not efficiency, it’s a meaningless ratio here.",
        "c": "This ratio does not define efficiency.",
        "d": "This is the inverse of efficiency."

      "correctAnswer": "a",

    {
      "question": "What happens to the fluid when it passes through the rotating impeller?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Its temperature decreases",
        "b": "It moves to the suction pipe",
        "c": "Its velocity and pressure increase",
        "d": "It gets compressed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Temperature changes are minimal and not primary function.",
        "b": "Fluid enters through the suction pipe, not moves to it after impeller.",
        "c": "Correct! The impeller increases fluid velocity and pressure.",
        "d": "Fluids are generally incompressible in pumps; pressure increase is due to energy addition, not compression."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
